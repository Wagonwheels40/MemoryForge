            <p>I started this as a hobby project.  The sole aim of this flashcard website was to help language learners retain vocabulary better.  Although, I have also started this website to improve on my coding skills.</p>
            <p>I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS and the database MongoDB.  If anyone would like to contribute to this project, the source code is open for others to contribute to it.  I would love to have people improving this website or give me suggestions on how to improve it.</p>
            <p>My original idea was to create a website in which you could work through modules which were shaped like a mindmap.  Each node could be opened, which would then redirect you to a page in which you could work through the course and gradually increase your vocabulary range.  The problem with this is that I still don't have the skills to create this, but am working towards it.</p>
            <p>Right now, it's just a basic flashcard website with a set 'Travel Phrases' tab for Japanese learners.</p>
